<h2 align="center"><a  href="https://share.streamlit.io/amaanirfan19/car-scraper/main/app.py">Live Demo</a></h2>

## Description

- Built a web scraper using BeautifulSoup to scrape data from https://www.cars.com/ and create a dataframe from it.
- Created a machine learning model to predict car prices based on several features such as horsepower, torque, wheelbase etc
- Achieved an accuracy of 90% and the model trains the data in real time based on the updates on the website!

## Limitations
- Web Scraping takes quite some time to retrieve the data due to get requests , parsing and filtering the data to make it optimal for training the model

## Future Modifications
- Will create a deep learning model to classify cars based on their profile pictures
- Wil create an option for users to import their own dataset and set the features as well the labels of their choice!
